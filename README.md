## **How It Works** :
-When the application starts, the system presents the user with a main menu containing the options listed above.

-Based on the userâ€™s input, the system will interact with the MySQL database via JDBC to perform the selected operation (e.g., adding a patient, viewing appointments, etc.).

-The operations include adding, updating, or retrieving data from the database, ensuring smooth management of patient records, doctor availability, and appointments.

-Each option is designed to ensure that the Hospital Management System is efficient, user-friendly, and operates seamlessly.
